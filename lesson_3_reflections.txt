When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Your code is safe if something happens to your local computer!


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You might be working on something in progress and don't want it overwritten. Or you are working ahead and don't want the work to be erased.
