How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It reduced the number of lines to check from hundres to six.
It let the computer do the hard work, letting me focus on debugging!

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
You can understand what changes were made to address which issues.
You can also find the part of code causing the bug, and separate it from the successful edits.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Manual save points add more meaning for each and between each version.
You have more control over the saving work flow.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git wants to keep the logc of connect files together, while Google Docs
allows fore more flexibility.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You can make the change you want, and find the exact version of when something was broken to fix it. No worrying about losing loads of progress from one bug!
